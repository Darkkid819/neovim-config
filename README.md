# My Neovim Configuration

This is my custom Neovim setup, built on top of [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). It includes the following enhancements:

- **Language support**: Added Treesitter configurations for multiple languages
- **Plugins**: 
  - `telescope.nvim` for fuzzy finding files, LSP, etc.
  - `gitsigns.nvim` for Git integration.
  - `nvim-cmp` for autocompletion with LuaSnip for snippets.
  - `todo-comments.nvim` for highlighting TODOs in comments.
  - `mini.nvim` for statusline and surrounding text objects.
- **Keymaps**: Custom keybindings
